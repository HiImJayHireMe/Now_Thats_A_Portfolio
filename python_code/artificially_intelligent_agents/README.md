The name of the file says it all:  Watch the red dot hunt the blue dot!  The black dots indicate the red dot's _sensor_ readings (which are subject to a degree of error).  The green dot is the _current_ position of the blue dot.  The red dot has 1000 steps to catch the blue dot.  It does so with ~90% success rate at 5% sensor noise.

This is a fully runnable stand-alone file.  Please note that all necessary library functions are included for convenience so that it can be run without any dependencies.

   Normally these would be organized into categorically separate modules.

   Enjoy! :)

# Search and Sort

Here are a few cracks at some sorting algorithms.  `binary_search` is pretty old,
but I think you'll find `merge_sort` and `quicksort` interesting.

`merge_sort` features mutual recursion, while `quicksort` demonstrates the difference
between traditional quicksort approaches and a functional approach.

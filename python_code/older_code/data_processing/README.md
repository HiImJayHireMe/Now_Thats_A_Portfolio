# Data Processing

Here is some robust if ugly data processing code for telecom data.
My boss was an old-school `C` guy, so I was never allowed to use anything fancy like
the `DataPipeline` I wrote in `data_processing_utils` but I still managed to sneak in a generator once in awhile.

 The code you're seeing is a non-proprietary version in the spirit of the code I would have written for processing this type of data.

 It's also quite different from the way I code today.

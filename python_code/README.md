# python_code

Thanks for taking a moment to look at my Python code portfolio.

If you only get a change to look at one thing, check out `functional_tools/tools.py`, it's very indicative of
 my _preferred_ coding style (but I can code any paradigm you please!)

If you want a live demo, you run can run `artificially_intelligent_agents/red_dot_hunts_blue_dot.py`
for a neat graphical game of death between dots!

If you only have time to check one one more thing, `search_and_sort/mergesort.py` I demonstrate
mutually recursive functions while in `search_and_sort/quicksort.py` I compare traditional quicksort
methods to purely functional implementations.


 I really embrace the [unix-philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Origin) in the sense of small,
 robust, yet easy to grok functions that do one thing very well, then combining these powerful tools to create complex behavior.

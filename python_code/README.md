# python_code

Thanks for taking a moment to look at my Python code portfolio.

If you only get a chance to look at one thing, check out [`functional_tools/tools.py`](https://github.com/HiImJayHireMe/Now_Thats_A_Portfolio/tree/master/python_code/functional_tools), it's very indicative of
 my _preferred_ coding style (but I can code any paradigm you please!).  It's more or less a direct port of my
 functional tools library, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/naga/, less a few cool features like `LazySeq`.

If you want to see work I've done on language development, check out [[bracket]!](https://github.com/HiImJayHireMe/bracket).

If you want a live demo, you run can run [`artificially_intelligent_agents/red_dot_hunts_blue_dot.py`](https://github.com/HiImJayHireMe/Now_Thats_A_Portfolio/tree/master/python_code/artificially_intelligent_agents)
for a neat graphical game of death between dots!

If you're interested to see (one way) how I handle concurrency in Python (and you like mangas!), 
check out [`mangaripper`](https://github.com/HiImJayHireMe/mangaripper).  I'm not sure why everyone complains about the GIL, it's really not all that bad :)

If you love Peter Norvig like I do, check out my tribute to his work in [`regex_golf`](https://github.com/HiImJayHireMe/Now_Thats_A_Portfolio/tree/master/python_code/regex_golf).

If you only have time to check one one more thing, [`search_and_sort/mergesort.py`](https://github.com/HiImJayHireMe/Now_Thats_A_Portfolio/blob/master/python_code/search_and_sort/mergesort.py) I demonstrate
mutually recursive functions while in [`search_and_sort/quicksort.py`](https://github.com/HiImJayHireMe/Now_Thats_A_Portfolio/blob/master/python_code/search_and_sort/quicksort.py) I compare traditional quicksort
methods to purely functional implementations.

Lest you think I don't know how to do OO, check out [`older_code/fizzbuzz_progression_demo`](https://github.com/HiImJayHireMe/Now_Thats_A_Portfolio/tree/master/python_code/older_code/fizzbuzz_progression_demo) where I
take a familiar problem and over-engineer the hell out of it with some of the most popular OO/Python patterns.  ;)

 I really embrace the [unix-philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Origin) in the sense of small,
 robust, yet easy to grok functions that do one thing very well, then combining these powerful tools to create complex behavior.

# clojure_work

Although I'm a huge cheerleader for Python, Clojure has a few advantages
for functional programmers that are just impossible to ignore.  From an AI
perspective, the fact that Clojure (like all LISPs) features homoiconic
language constructs (the code is _itself_ a form of data) makes it ideal
 for source code introspection and re-writing.  I'm very much a n00b at Clojure
 so these are my dabblings!
